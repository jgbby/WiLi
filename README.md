WiLi is our very own wireless lock system! Users log in through this portal and have specialized 
access to each of their owned wili locks. This product is built for college campuses where
multiple individuals might be staying in one place. We hope to solve the problem of having to pay that
pesky $350 (or more!) to get let back into your room when you lose those tiny keys while you're out and about!

You can check out a demo version of our website at https://wili-security.herokuapp.com/.
Made with Flask and a PostGreSQL integrated database all with custom design and web development.
